# Polyline-Smoother

A repository of programs regarding 2D Polyline vertex smoothing.

PolylineSmoother:
    -A simple "smoothing" algorithm that moves the vertices according to the average between itself and the adjacent vertices.
    
PolylineSmoother-ChaikinAlgorithm: (WORK IN PROGRESS)
    -An implementation of the Chaikin Algorithm used to "smoothen" polylines by "cutting" corners.
